[Kaprekar's Constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6174_(number)), the number 6174, is a special number named after Indian Mathematician D.R. Kaprekar. This number is renowned for the following rule:

1. Take any four-digit number, using at least two different digits (leading zeros are allowed). 
2. Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary. 
3. Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.
4. Go back to step 2 and repeat.

The above process, known as Kaprekar's routine, will always reach a fixed point 6174, in at most 7 iterations.
